# ESP32-BME280-AppInventor


Testing to see how to make the ESP32 talk to my phone through Nordic nRF Connect<br>
then onto adding in the MIT App Inventor.

I want to make it so the ESP32 will do two way bluetooth communication.

This is just the first step into an end project to be able to display items on a<br> 
screen and be able to manipulate them from my phone.<br>
